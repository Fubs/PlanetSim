Planet Simulator:

You'll need pygame to run the simulator, so if you don't have it installed already, run

> pip3 install pygame --user

Make sure to change the width and height variables to your liking before running the program. Usually you'll want

> width = 1900

> height = 1000

Arrow keys control the blue dot, (r) resets the velocities and randomizes the positions, and (q) quits.
